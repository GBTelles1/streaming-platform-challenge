## Getting started

### Installing

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Due to a problem with the react version (19), I could not install the json-server locally, only globally:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

### Running

If you have json-server globally, to start it you can just run:

```bash
npm run server
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And you will see the project's web version on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>
